# Transfer-Learning-with-TensorFlow
This repository will use the pretrained model from Tensorflow ImageNet Inception V3 (https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/inception_v3/feature_vector/3)
We will re-train the model to be able to classify if a chest X-ray shows if the patient has pneumonia or not
The image dataset we will use for re-training can be found on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
